## Advanced Configuration

### Custom Fields

The server can work with any Jira configuration:

#### Option 1: Auto-Detection (Recommended)
Leave custom field IDs unset in `.env` and the server will automatically detect them based on field names.

#### Option 2: Manual Configuration
If auto-detection doesn't work, configure custom field IDs in your `.env`:

```env
JIRA_FIELD_STORY_POINTS=customfield_10001
JIRA_FIELD_ACCEPTANCE_CRITERIA=customfield_10002
JIRA_FIELD_EPIC_LINK=customfield_10003
```

#### Finding Field IDs
Use the `diagnose-fields` tool to find the correct field IDs for your Jira instance:
```
diagnose-fields project:"PROJ" issueType:"Story"
```

### Auto-create Test Tickets

Enable automatic test ticket creation for stories:

```env
AUTO_CREATE_TEST_TICKETS=true
```

## Troubleshooting

### Working with Different Jira Configurations

This MCP server is designed to work with **any Jira instance** regardless of:
- Language settings (English, Czech, German, etc.)
- Custom field configurations
- Project-specific settings

**Best Practices:**
1. Use `get-fields` to see available issue types in your language
2. Use `diagnose-fields` to find custom field IDs
3. Create issues using the exact issue type names from your Jira

### Common Issues

1. **Authentication Failed**
   - Verify your API token is correct
   - Ensure your email matches your Atlassian account
   - Check that your Jira instance URL includes `https://`

2. **Project Not Found**
   - Verify you have access to the project
   - Check the project key is correct (case-sensitive)

3. **Custom Fields Not Working**
   - Use `diagnose-fields` tool to find the correct field IDs for your project
   - Use `get-fields` tool to see all available fields
   - Custom field IDs typically start with `customfield_`
   - Some fields may not be available for certain issue types (e.g., labels on Epics)
   - Epic Link field ID varies between Jira instances

4. **Link Type Not Found**
   - Use `get-link-types` tool to see available link types
   - Link types are case-sensitive in Jira API
   - The server will try to match case-insensitively
   - Epic-Story relationships use epicLink field, not regular issue links

5. **Epic-Story Linking Issues**
   - Run `diagnose-fields` for project and "Story" issue type
   - Update JIRA_FIELD_EPIC_LINK in .env with the correct field ID
   - Restart the MCP server after updating .env

### Debug Mode

Set the `DEBUG` environment variable for verbose logging:

```bash
DEBUG=* claude --mcp "./run.sh"
# or
DEBUG=jira-mcp claude --mcp "./run.sh"
```

### View Logs

Logs are output to stderr and include:
- Connection status
- API requests and responses
- Error details with context
- Performance metrics
